# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Evan Weinstein

### Python Script Functionality

- Your `main.py` script correctly reads the CSV file, aggregates session data by algorithm, and calculates:
  - The average happiness rating per algorithm
  - The total number of sessions per algorithm
  - The average session duration per algorithm
- The script correctly identifies that **JoyStream** has the highest average happiness rating (8.5) and **DeepPulse** has the longest average session duration (45.0 minutes), matching the example output.
- **Suggestion:** There is a leftover debugging statement (`print(stats['JoyStream'])`) that isnâ€™t required in the final output. Removing or commenting out this line will make your output cleaner. For example:

  ```python
  # print(stats['JoyStream'])  # Remove or comment out this debugging statement
  ```

### Report Documentation

- Your `report.md` is well-structured with appropriate sections (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Observations, and Conclusions). However, it still contains placeholder text (e.g., "..." for the results).
- **To fully meet the requirements:**
  - Replace the placeholders with the actual values computed by your script.
  - Provide a brief description of your methodology, outlining how you read the data, performed the calculations, and derived the insights.
  - Include observations or insights based on the analysis (for example, noting the performance differences among the algorithms and any potential implications for user engagement).

---

Overall, Evan, your Python code demonstrates a solid understanding of file I/O, data parsing, and basic statistical computation. Updating your report with the actual analysis details and computed results will complete the assignment and more fully showcase your data analysis skills.

GRADE: B+
